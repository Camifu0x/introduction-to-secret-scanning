## Finish üèÜ

_Congratulations friend, you've completed this course!_ 

Here's a recap of all the tasks you've accomplished in your repository:

- Enabled secret scanning on your repository
- Committed a secret to the repository
- Reviewed secrets that have been identified by secret scanning
- Closed a secret scanning alert
- Enabled secret scanning push protection to prevent secrets from being written to the repository
- Attempted to commit a secret, but had that commit stopped by push protection
- Bypassed the push protection

It's important to note that secret scanning capabilities are only available for public repositories. Customers needing additional capabilities should investigate [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security). In addition to the features you worked with here, Advanced Security also provides the following features:

-  Custom secret scanning patterns
-  Non-partner and generic patterns including passwords, RSA and SSH keys, and database connection strings
-  Code scanning with CodeQL
-  Security Overview
-  Supply chain security capabilities
